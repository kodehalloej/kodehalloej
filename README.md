# Hi, I’m Daniel

I’m a backend developer based in Denmark with over 20 years of experience
in .NET and C#. I specialize in enterprise-grade solutions using Sitecore
and Umbraco. My work typically involves a lot of coding 👨‍💻, system
integrations 🧩, and some infrastructure setup 🛠️.

Over the years, I’ve worked with clients across various sectors —
including energy 🔋, logistics 🚚, education 🎓, government 🏛️, and member
organizations 👥. I’m used to working in agile environments and adapt
quickly to each client’s preferred setup.

I started out as a fullstack developer, so I know my way around frontend
technologies as well. It’s been especially helpful when collaborating with
frontend teams. I still enjoy doing some frontend development on the side.
