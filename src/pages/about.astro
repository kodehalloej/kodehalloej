        I’m a backend developer based in Denmark with over 20 years of
        experience in .NET and C#. I specialize in enterprise-grade solutions
        using Sitecore and Umbraco. My work typically involves a lot of coding
        👨‍💻, system integrations 🔌, and some infrastructure setup ⚙️.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Over the years, I’ve worked with clients across various sectors —
        including energy 🔋, logistics ⛴️, education 👨‍🎓, government 🏛️, and
        unions 🫱🏻‍🫲🏾. I’m used to working in agile environments and adapt quickly
        to each client’s preferred setup.

        I started out as a fullstack developer, so I know my way around frontend
        technologies as well. It’s been especially helpful when collaborating
        with frontend teams. I still enjoy doing some frontend development on
        the side — like this site, made with Astro 🚀 and Tailwind CSS 🎨.
