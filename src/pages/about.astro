      I’m a backend developer based in Denmark with over 20 years of experience
      in .NET and C#. I specialize in enterprise-grade solutions using Sitecore
      and Umbraco. My work typically involves a lot of coding 👨‍💻, system
      integrations 🧩, and some infrastructure setup 🛠️.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-1">
      Over the years, I’ve worked with clients across various sectors —
      including energy 🔋, logistics 🚚, education 🎓, government 🏛️, and member
      organizations 👥. I’m used to working in agile environments and adapt
      quickly to each client’s preferred setup.

      I started out as a fullstack developer, so I know my way around frontend
      technologies as well. It’s been especially helpful when collaborating with
      frontend teams. I still enjoy doing some frontend development on the side
      — like this site, made with Astro 🚀 and Tailwind CSS 🎨.
